# Contributing to go-watermill-template

First of all, thank you 🙇🏾‍♀️ for considering contributing to go-watermill-template; it needs all the help it can get!

This contribution guide is an extension to the core contributing guide that can be found [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/.github/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md). Please make sure you go through that beforehand. 🙂👍🏽

# Design

This repo was created from the template repo [template-for-generator-templates](https://github.com/asyncapi/template-for-generator-templates)

It has borrowed most of its concepts from it

Also check out this intial [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ueeYM_0hck) where some of the concepts about a generator are discussed.

This generator has 2 main concepts

1. [template](https://github.com/asyncapi/go-watermill-template/tree/master/template)
2. [components](https://github.com/asyncapi/go-watermill-template/tree/master/components)

## Generated Code

The code generated by this template has the following structure

- __asyncapi__
  - [handlers.go](asyncapi/handlers.go)
  - [payloads.go](asyncapi/payloads.go)
  - [publishers.go](asyncapi/publishers.go)
  - [router.go](asyncapi/router.go)
  - [server.go](asyncapi/server.go)
  - [subscribers.go](asyncapi/subscribers.go)
- [go.mod](go.mod)
- [go.sum](go.sum)
- [main.go](main.go)

For each of the above files genenrated there should be a corresponding `.js` file under the templates direectory.
These template files parse take the parsed `asyncapi` doc as an input and then delegate to the responsibility of generating code to the react components under the `components` directory

## Development

It is not easy to write code in one language to generate code in another language.
In this case code is being written in `js` to generate `go` code.
Hence the best way to develop is to first develop the `go` code that one intends to generate.
One may consider this [repo](https://github.com/anandsunderraman/watermill-reference) for example where the working `go` code is first developed and is used as reference to author the above templates

## Dev Testing

In order to dev test the generated code consider running the npm command

```
npm run dev
```

This generates `go` code to the dir `output` based on the asyncapi sample file [here](https://github.com/asyncapi/go-watermill-template/blob/master/test/asyncapi.yaml)

Once the `go` code is generated, one can navigate to the `output` directory and run `go run main.go` to test the generated code.
Importantly one must have the appropriate broker or messaging software running locally to be able to test it successfully
